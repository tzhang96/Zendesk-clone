1. Core Data Model and Database in Supabase
1.1 Ticket Table
• ticket_id (UUID / Primary Key)
• created_at (timestamp)
• updated_at (timestamp)
• status (e.g., "open", "pending", "resolved", "closed")
• priority (e.g., "low", "medium", "high")
• title (string) — brief summary of the ticket
• description (text) — the main body of the ticket
• tags (text[] or JSONB) — for grouping or classification
• assigned_to (UUID) — references "users" table (the agent, if assigned)
• created_by (UUID) — references "users" table (the customer/employee who created the ticket)
• conversation_history (JSONB or separate table) — captures all interactions, including AI-generated ones if relevant
1.2 Users Table
• user_id (UUID / Primary Key)
• email (string)
• name (string)
• role (e.g., “customer”, “agent”, “admin”)
• created_at (timestamp)
• updated_at (timestamp)
1.3 Relationships and Permissions
• Take advantage of Supabase’s Row-Level Security (RLS) to ensure that:
– Customers can only view/create their own tickets.
– Agents can read and respond to tickets assigned to them or in their queue.
– Admins have wide read/write access.
• Optionally store internal notes in a separate table referencing ticket_id, accessible only to certain roles.
1.4 Migration & Schema Management
• Use Supabase migrations to keep the schema consistent across all environments.
• For custom fields, build a flexible JSONB column (e.g., “custom_fields”) or a separate “ticket_fields” table keyed by ticket_id.

2. API-First Strategy
2.1 Supabase as Primary Data Layer
• Use Supabase’s PostgREST and/or GraphQL for most CRUD operations:
– GET /tickets
– POST /tickets
– PATCH /tickets/:id
– … etc.
• Incorporate stored procedures or Edge Functions for more complex business logic — e.g., ticket assignment, AI calls, or user notifications.
2.2 Supabase Edge Functions
• Create serverless functions (TypeScript/Deno) for operations requiring specialized logic, such as AI calls, advanced search, or hooking into external systems (e.g., Slack, email).
• Keep these Edge Functions “small and specialized,” focusing on core tasks (AI or advanced routing).
2.3 Real-Time Subscriptions
• Supabase real-time channels can notify the React frontend of ticket status changes, new assignments, or new messages.
• This ensures a live, collaborative experience similar to Zendesk’s live ticket feed.
---
3. React Frontend Architecture
3.1 Project Organization
• Use a standard React + TypeScript + Tailwind setup.
• Folder structure example:
– src/
• components/
– Tickets/ (TicketList, TicketForm, TicketDetail, etc.)
– Shared/
• pages/
– Dashboard.tsx
– TicketDetailPage.tsx
– AdminPanel.tsx
• services/ (API connectors to Supabase, Edge Functions)
• contexts/ (Auth context, user role context)
• hooks/ (custom data fetching hooks, for instance “useTickets”)
3.2 Ticket Lifecycle UI
• Ticket List/Queue: Filter by status or assigned team.
• Ticket Creation: Simple form that calls POST /tickets.
• Ticket Details Page:
– Conversation history
– AI-suggested responses (later feature)
– Internal notes (if agent or admin)
– Update status, priority, assignment
3.3 Role-Based Rendering
• Conditionally render features and pages based on user roles stored in Supabase or the auth token.
– Use a React Context (e.g., AuthContext) to store the user’s role and permissions.
3.4 Theming and Styling
• Use Tailwind classes for consistent, fast styling.
• Keep a small set of utility and layout components to standardize the UI.

4. AI Integration Roadmap
4.1 First Steps: LLM-Generated Responses
• Once the MVP is stable, add an “AI Suggestions” box in TicketDetailPage:
– When an agent or admin opens a ticket, call a Supabase Edge Function that queries an LLM, passing the ticket content and conversation history.
– Return suggested responses or next steps.
4.2 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Support
• Store FAQ or knowledge base articles in Supabase’s vector store.
• Before generating a response, retrieve the most relevant FAQ entries and feed them into your LLM for context.
• Start with a minimal set of relevant knowledge; expand later to handle more topics.
4.3 Agentic Tool-Using AI
• Add functionality for AI to classify or assign tickets automatically based on text classification.
• For more advanced features (like automatic escalation or external API calls), build modular “tools” that the AI can call via Edge Functions.
4.4 Human-in-the-Loop
• Provide a “Review Suggestions” button or workflow that shows the agent the AI’s recommended response.
• Let humans edit or approve the AI’s text; store outcomes for continuous improvement.

5. Deployment and CI/CD
5.1 Version Control
• Use GitHub for source code, ensuring code reviews and PR-based workflows.
• Keep your Supabase migrations, schema definitions, and edge functions versioned in the same repo.
5.2 CI/CD Pipeline with AWS Amplify 2.0
• Amplify monitors the GitHub repo for commits.
• On commit/merge to main branch:
– Build React app (npm install, npm run build).
– Deploy to AWS Amplify.
– Run Supabase migrations (either manually or automatically using GitHub Actions before Amplify deployment).
5.3 Environment Management
• Staging vs. Production:
– Separate Amplify environments.
– Separate Supabase projects or distinct database schemas.
– Keep environment secrets in secure storage (Amplify environment variables or GitHub Actions secrets).

6. Performance and Scalability
6.1 Caching and Query Optimization
• Short-term: Rely on Supabase’s managed Postgres caching.
• For frequent complex queries, create indexes on columns like status, assigned_to, created_at.
• Consider caching AI responses per ticket to avoid repeated identical LLM calls.
6.2 Load Testing
• Use tools (e.g., k6, Artillery) to test high traffic on critical endpoints (POST /tickets, etc.).
• Evaluate performance of real-time updates (Supabase real-time) under load.
6.3 Edge Functions for AI
• Move large or frequent AI calls to a specialized environment (Amplify or dedicated compute) if they exceed Supabase’s limits.
• Ensure the system falls back gracefully if AI calls fail or resources are exhausted.

7. Potential Contradictions & Questions
Hosting Contradiction?
– The plan suggests storing data and running Edge Functions on Supabase, but deploying the UI on AWS Amplify. Confirm that’s acceptable.
AI Hosting?
– If the agent is too large or needs Python-based frameworks, we may have to switch from Supabase Edge Functions to AWS Lambda or a container-based solution.
Data Volume?
– If large attachments or massive conversation histories are expected, confirm we can rely on Supabase’s object store or consider external solutions (e.g., S3).

Summary
Use Supabase as a single source of truth for data, authentication, and real-time features.
Expose a clean REST/GraphQL API for core CRM operations.
Build the React + Tailwind frontend to consume these APIs, incorporating role-based access.
After MVP (ticket creation, listing, detail, user roles), add AI functionalities in phases—starting with suggested responses, then more advanced features (RAG, auto-routing, agentic AI).
Deploy the frontend on AWS Amplify. Use GitHub for version control and tie in Supabase migrations.
Keep an eye on performance: create indexes, offload heavy AI tasks to edge functions or serverless providers as needed.
This design balances rapid MVP development with the flexibility to expand into advanced AI features. If anything here seems to conflict with your overall goals or tech stack, let me know so we can refine.
